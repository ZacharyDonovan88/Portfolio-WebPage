# Portfolio WebPage

## User Story
AS AN empolyer. I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples 
SO THAT I can review samples of thier work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Description
This is a WebPage for empolyers to visit and inspect my portfolio. 

## What could be changed
- change side navbar to bar to top as it would of potentially ran better for mobile modes
- possibily card content could of used more spacing in between each other
- maybe a background colour or a picture to make it less simple

## Notes
WebPage has been tested and should be compatible on all supported broswers including mobile devices.
